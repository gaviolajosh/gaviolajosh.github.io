Now that I have a hypervisor host with enough CPU cores and RAM to run a decent sized network simulation software, I've decided to take look into creating an EVE-NG VM.   
I wasn't quiet sure how much overhead I could give to this EVE-NG VM, but I decided on the following config:   
- 8 total cores running in a dual socket 4 core config
- 32GB of RAM
- 160GB of storage


There was the option for installing this on bare metal, but ideally I would need another fairly powerful server to act as a host. Since I don't have that I have to go with using a VM. 
For the install I used the V6.2.0-4 community edition (CE) on the [EVE-NG website](https://www.eve-ng.net/index.php/download/). VM setup wise, it configures the same as any other VM.

Once the VM is up and running, the installation itself takes a fairly long time to build, but the prompts are simple and populated with with default options.

One thing to note is that you need nested virtualization enabled in both the BIOS and the VM itself.   
For Intel CPUs that is: 
```
cat /sys/module/kvm_intel/parameters/nested
```
and you should see a `Y` or a `1`   

For AMD CPUs that is: 
```
cat /sys/module/kvm_amd/parameters/nested
```
and you should expect the same results.   

If you see a `N` or a `0`, you need to enable nested virtualization in the VM host itself.   
For Intel CPUs that is: 
```
# echo "options kvm-intel nested=Y" > /etc/modprobe.d/kvm-intel.conf
```
   
For AMD CPUs that is: 
```
# echo "options kvm-amd nested=1" > /etc/modprobe.d/kvm-amd.conf
```  

Then you would need to reboot the kernal module:   
```
modprobe -r kvm_intel
modprobe kvm_intel
```
(for AMD replace `intel` with `amd`)

Proxmox has [documentation](https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Nested_Virtualization) on this on their wiki, but for other hypervisors it might be best to see if they have documentation specific to that hypervisor.
