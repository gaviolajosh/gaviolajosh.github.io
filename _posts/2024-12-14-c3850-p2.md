I tried just about everything I could find online to try and extract that IOS from the switch, but nothing worked. 
I was finally able to get the same IOS, because I work at a place that is able to get them from Cisco's website... 
I don't know why I didn't think to use the resources I have to get it that way, but at least I had it now. 


The next hurdle was that newer Cisco switches seem to officially support using a proprietary USB drive to work on their devices. However, after some reading online there are some USB drives that will work. Funnily enough, the drives that work the best are the no-name company-branded USBs you get at a company booth at a fair. The drives that blatant security risks that you usually shouldn't trust just so happen to work the best. Tech is wonderful. For reference the USB seem to need to be < 4GB in space and be formatted in FAT to be recognized on the Cisco switch. 

Will finish later.
