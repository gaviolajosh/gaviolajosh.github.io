Another desirable skill I've been seeing on job postings is PowerShell.
Foruntately PowerShell and Active Directory go hand in hand as PowerShell allows you to manipulate basically anything about a Windows machine through code.
By using PowerShell ISE, I can create a basic script that allows me to configure new users and assign them to pre-established groups on the fly.



This is just a basic script, but this can easily be scaled up to include other functions and prompts to include other info a sysadmin/business might want to utilize.

(Unfortunately this script is on a VM, which does not allow me to easily copy the plain text here)
