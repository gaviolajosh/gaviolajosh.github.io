I've been looking at how I can monitor my Proxmox host's status without having to look at the web-gui every time.
Because of the issues I previously had issues with my Dashy install files via Portainer, it lead me to learning about [Glances](https://github.com/nicolargo/glances) which is an open-source monitoring tool that Dashy widgets use to present info about your system.



I was able to reference this [video](https://youtu.be/dyur-NDngBc?si=XOGaDHIYqm-u2kun) along with the [documentation](https://glances.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) on the Glances website.  
The setup is fairly simple in Linux:
If you don't have `PyPI` installed, you would need to first install that on the machine via  
```
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
```

If you have `PyPI`, then you can install it by using  
```
pip3 install glances
pip3 install bottle
pip3 install fastapi
```
or
```
pip3 install glances[all]
```
either or should work, but I did the first method because of an issue I ran into with my initial install.  
I ran into an issue where it wouldn't allow me to install it only using that command, I had to put `--break-system-packages` at the end of each line to bypass the restriction.  

Next to run Glances as a constant web service, I used
```
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/glances.service
```
to create a glances service file for the machine to run in case of a restart.  
Inside that file you want to paste this text:
```
[Unit]
Description = Glances in Web Server Mode
After = network.target

[Service]
ExecStart = /usr/local/bin/glances -w
Restart = always
RemainAfterExit = no

[Install]
WantedBy = multi-user.target
```
Because I am installing this on my entire Proxmox machine via the `root` user, my filepath is `/usr/local/bin/glances`, but yours may be different.  
In that case you can do
```
which glances
```
to find the path you need to use instead.  
I believe you would also have to add a line within the [Service] section that says `User = nameofuser`  

After that you can start up Glances via.
```
sudo systemctl start glances.service
sudo systemctl enable glances.service
sudo systemctl status glances.service
```
and you should see `Active: Running` after the status command.  
It will now be hosted as a internal website that you can access via: `localhost:61208` or replace `localhost` with the ip of the machine it was installed on.

I was able to use an old iPhone 7 to run as a sort of quick-access screen to monitor
