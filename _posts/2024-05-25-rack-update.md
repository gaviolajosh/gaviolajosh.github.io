I've been searching for used server hardware on places like Facebook marketplace and Ebay, and I was able to find a few good deals to help organize my setup better.  
A few things I was able to do was:
- flip the desktop chassis horizontally to mimic a server chassis
  - (I plan on moving everything to a 2U short depth chassis in the future)
- add a few more sturdier shelves
- replace the battery in my UPS with a higher AH one
- add a watt meter to measure power draw


I also realized that I'm running into some issues with the depth and post design of the server rack that I currently have. A lot of server hardware is very deep and my rack only has a depth of ~18" which prohibits me from using full length hardware.  
I think for right now what I am using should be fine, but in the future I will most likely upgrade to a larger server rack so that I can utilize more advanced hardware.  
A CAT 5e keystone patch panel is also on the to-do list for me in the future.  

It now looks like this:

It isn't too much but it feels a bit easier to navigate as opposed to the previous layout:
