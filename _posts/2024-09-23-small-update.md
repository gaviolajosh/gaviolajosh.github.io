After that last post I really had to step back and evaluate what I was doing with my homelab.
While I really enjoyed working with that Optiplex, the thought of buying more old tech (that might catch fire) scared me off of second-hand sites for a while and also hurt the wallet since I had no buyer protection. 

For now I think the goal is to let what I currently have run, and monitor it to make sure it continues working as intended for the longterm.
While that's happening I'm thinking of getting my Sec+ and/or JNCIA-Junos certificate either before the end of the year or early next year.
It should be achievable, but the end of the year is always a busy time for me.
