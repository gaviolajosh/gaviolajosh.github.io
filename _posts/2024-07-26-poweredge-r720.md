It's been a while since my last post, but I have not stopped working on my homelab since. 
In fact I've been quiet busy with onboarding on a new job as a Network Operations Center Tech I.

I was able to receive a Dell Poweredge R720 for my own personal use.


The specs for this particular R720 are:   
- Dual 8 Core Xeon E5-2665 2.4GHz CPUs
  - (plans are to lower overall TDP to dual 10 Core Xeon E5-2648L V2 1.9GHZ or a single 12 Core Xeon E5-2695 V2 2.4GHz)
- 64Gb DDR3 1600MT/s ECC RAM
  - (also plan to get more because it's so cheap)
- 2 x 256Gb Sata SSDs running in a mirrored RAID 1 config
- 4 x 4Tb Sata HDDs running in RAID 1 as well
- 4 x 1Gb port NIC
- PERC H710p Mini RAID controller [flashed into IT mode](https://fohdeesha.com/docs/perc.html)
  
I understand that this piece of hardware is already EOL, but with the overall compute power available and cost to performance being not too far off from my built virtualization server, it's not a bad kit for me to learn Enterprise equipment.  
My plans going forward with this server are to migrate my existing Proxmox virtualization server's config to this server. As well as use the larger overhead compute to run VMs of higher demand services such as EVE-NG.
