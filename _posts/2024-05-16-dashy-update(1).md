I've been trying to implement more monitoring widgets to my Dashy page, but I've run into some issues with trying to configure the Dashy conf.yml file.  
I can't seem to find the files in my linux VM where they should be.  
It may be because of my [Portainer](https://www.portainer.io/) install interacting with my Dashy install, but I need to learn more about both to track down the issue.
